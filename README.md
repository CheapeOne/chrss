## Local Development

This project is built with the serverless framework. To start, install serverless following these instructions:

https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/

TL;DR, you'll need node, npm, the serverless library, an AWS account, and AWS authentication set up on your machine.

Then all you need to do is run:

`sls deploy`

Or test a function locally running:

`sls invoke local -f hello`
